# B-Tree
## My implementation of the B-Tree data structure.

To run the B-Tree program, use "make run".

When the program first starts, the terminal will be cleared, and the user will be asked to input a number (N) where N >= 400.

As long as the user submitted a valid input, the program will build the B-Tree using N number of random integers in the range [0,3N].

Once the B-Tree has been built, the program will output all keys in the tree in ascending order, and it will search the tree for keys in the range [N, 2N] and output found keys.
